# Product Roadmap

Sequencing guide for all Journey Tracker development. Organized into four shippable phases, each a coherent increment. Every phase respects the core brand direction: accumulation over completion, no shame mechanics, warm/steady/humane.

---

## Current State (Baseline)

**What exists:**
- Step CRUD (create, complete by tap, delete) backed by Supabase
- Anonymous + email auth with anonymous-to-authenticated migration (`claim_anonymous_todos` RPC)
- Journey assignment per Step (5 default journeys seeded per user via DB trigger)
- Journey color system via CSS custom properties (`data-journey-slug` pattern)
- Steps grouped by Journey with color-coded headers
- Completion expressed as reduced opacity (no checkboxes)
- Progress counter: "X steps today"
- Timestamp display (relative for today, date for older)
- Mobile-first responsive layout, Source Sans 3 + Fraunces typography

**Scaffolded but no UI:**
- `milestones` table (`journey_id`, `name`, `sort_order`)
- `paths` table (`name` only, no journey association)
- No `step_paths` junction table

**Priority alignment (from visualization spec):**

| Priority | Components | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| P0 | Step Tile, Journey Color System, Step Stack, Progress Counter | Built |
| P1 | Paths, Milestones, Trail View, Zoom Nav | Phase 2 |
| P2 | Journey Balance Wheel, PERMA Signal Bars | Phase 3 |
| P3 | Ikigai Path Indicator | Phase 4 |

## Phase 1 — Refine the Foundation

*Codify the design principles that govern every future decision. Refine the empty state. Align all documentation.*

### Goals

1. Establish the three core design principles: hemisphere separation, interaction weight constraint, no self-assessment
2. Align all existing documentation to these principles
3. Refine the empty state to reflect brand voice
4. Ensure the existing Today view is a clean foundation for Phase 2

### Key Deliverables

**Documentation Alignment**
- Add Design Principles section to `product-vision.md`
- Rewrite this roadmap to remove quality tags, duration tracking, momentum line, and satisfaction prompts
- Update `framework-reference.md` to use behavioral inference only
- Update `visualization-spec.md` to remove self-assessment and comparison mechanics
- Add guardrails to `brand-art-direction.md`

**Empty State**
- Brand-voice copy: "Every journey starts with a single step."
- Subtle visual warmth via `--font-family-heading` (Fraunces)

### Technical Tasks

**`src/main.js`**
- Update empty state copy in `renderSteps()`

**`src/style.css`**
- Update `.todo-empty` with `font-family: var(--font-family-heading)`

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All documentation references to quality tags, duration_minutes, satisfaction ratings, and momentum comparisons have been removed or corrected
- [ ] Design Principles section exists in `product-vision.md`
- [ ] Empty state reads "Every journey starts with a single step." in Fraunces
- [ ] Existing Step tile, Journey picker, and all CRUD operations work unchanged
- [ ] Passes emotion-first checklist from `brand-art-direction.md`

### Brand Guard

No self-assessment prompts. No performance comparisons on the Today view. The Today view accepts exactly one input: step text.

---

## Phase 2 — Paths, Milestones, and Trail View

*Give daily Steps a home in a larger story. Introduce the second and third data tiers with usable UI and build the first cross-day view.*

### Goals

1. Users can create and manage Paths — named personal contexts spanning Journeys
2. Steps can be optionally associated with a Path (many-to-many)
3. Milestones group Steps with visible progress bars and pace estimates
4. Trail View (week-level) shows linear trail per Path with frequency sparklines
5. Zoom navigation: Today ↔ This Week with breadcrumbs

### Key Deliverables

**Path Data Model + UI**
- Path CRUD (create, rename, archive)
- `step_paths` junction table (many-to-many)
- Path picker on Step creation form and existing tile (reuse journey picker pattern)
- Path badge on tile Layer 2 (shown only when association exists)
- Path management screen

**Milestone Data Model + UI**
- Milestone CRUD under a Journey, with optional target count and description
- Step-to-Milestone association via existing `milestone_id` FK
- Milestone picker on creation form (filtered by selected Journey)
- Milestone proximity indicator on tile Layer 2: compact progress bar
- Milestones list view with progress bars and recent contributing steps

**Trail View**
- Week-level view showing all active Paths
- Per-Path linear trail: `●` = Step, `⚑` = completed Milestone, `○` = current position
- Weekly sparkline (8-week history, inline SVG, no library dependency) — visual pattern only, no evaluative labels

**Zoom Navigation**
- Two-button tab strip: "Today" / "This Week"
- JS view-state toggle (`let currentView = 'today'`), CSS fade/slide transition
- Breadcrumb on tiles with hierarchy: `Vitality › Novel Writing › 50K Draft`
- Tappable breadcrumb segments for drill-down

### Technical Tasks

**New modules:**
- `src/paths.js` — Path CRUD functions
- `src/milestones.js` — Milestone CRUD functions
- `src/views.js` — View state management (`setView`, `getView`)
- `src/trail-view.js` — Trail View renderer (SVG trail + sparkline)

**`src/main.js` changes:**
- Import and wire new modules
- Add Path + Milestone pickers to creation form
- Update `addStep()` to insert into `step_paths` and set `milestone_id`
- Update `loadSteps()` to join `step_paths → paths` and `milestones`
- Render Layer 2 content (Path label, Milestone proximity) on tiles
- Zoom navigation handler + breadcrumb builder

**`src/style.css` additions:**
- `.trail-view`, `.path-trail`, `.sparkline`
- `.breadcrumb` strip (Journey › Path › Milestone)
- `.milestone-progress-bar`, `.milestone-proximity`
- `.view-nav`, `.view-nav__tab`

### Database Migration

```sql
-- step_paths junction table
create table public.step_paths (
  step_id uuid not null references public.steps(id) on delete cascade,
  path_id uuid not null references public.paths(id) on delete cascade,
  primary key (step_id, path_id)
);
alter table public.step_paths enable row level security;
create policy "Users can manage own step_paths"
  on public.step_paths for all
  using (exists (select 1 from public.steps s where s.id = step_paths.step_id and s.user_id = auth.uid()))
  with check (exists (select 1 from public.steps s where s.id = step_paths.step_id and s.user_id = auth.uid()));
create index step_paths_path_id on public.step_paths (path_id);
create index step_paths_step_id on public.step_paths (step_id);

-- extend paths table
alter table public.paths
  add column description  text,
  add column is_archived  boolean not null default false;

-- extend milestones table
alter table public.milestones
  add column description   text,
  add column target_count  integer check (target_count > 0),
  add column target_date   date,
  add column completed_at  timestamptz;
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Create a Path and assign a Step to it in under 5 seconds
- [ ] Path badge appears on tile only when association exists; nothing when absent
- [ ] Milestone progress bar shows compact visual (no percentage number on tile)
- [ ] Trail View renders linear trail per active Path with sparkline
- [ ] View switching is smooth and maintains Today scroll position on return
- [ ] Breadcrumb `Pursuits › Novel Writing › 50K Draft` appears on fully-associated tiles
- [ ] All existing Step CRUD works unchanged; Path/Milestone always optional

### Brand Guard

The trail shows where you've been, not scores performance. No evaluative labels like "Accelerating" or "Slowing" — the sparkline speaks for itself.

Milestone progress bars never show a warning state. A milestone at 10% is 10% further than 0%. The bar fills; it never depletes.

---

## Phase 2.5 — Sort, Filter, Archive & Delete

*Give users lightweight control over how they view and manage their steps. Preserve the accumulation record while allowing genuine corrections.*

### Goals

1. Sort & Filter controls on the Today view — weightless, opt-in, zero complexity
2. Establish Archive as the default completion path, preserving the accumulation record
3. Provide Delete as a distinct, intentional action for correcting errors

### Key Deliverables

**Sort & Filter**
- Chips or controls above `section.todo-app_items` to arrange items by journey, milestone, path, or step (alphabetically or chronologically)
- Visual treatment and interactions must feel weightless — consistent with the Interaction Weight Constraint
- Click to toggle sort direction; no additional complexity or configuration
- Sorting is opt-in, not default — respects Step Equality principle (chronological default preserved)

**Archive & Delete**
- **Archive**: Completed steps are archived, not trashed. The journey tracks progress and purpose — if we delete records of what we've done, we won't know how many steps we've taken or how far we've come. Archived steps continue to feed all framework visualizations and accumulation metrics.
- **Delete**: Reserved for actual errors — typos, duplicates, mistakes. When the intent is to remove an item from the records entirely. Deleted items are not tracked. This is a deliberate, distinct action from archiving.

### Brand Guard

Sort & Filter chips must not make the Today view feel heavier. They should feel like a gentle resorting of the same weightless content — not a toolbar or dashboard control.

Archive reinforces the core brand promise: accumulation over completion. Nothing meaningful is ever lost.

---

## Phase 3 — Framework Visualizations (Wheel + PERMA)

*Surface the meaning layer. This phase brings the Journey hemisphere to life — an exclusively data-exploration space where users reflect on their progress and see how their inputs accumulate within the Wheel of Life, PERMA, and Ikigai frameworks. Behavioral data becomes a coherent picture of life balance and well-being — without questionnaires.*

The Journey hemisphere is not task-oriented like Today. It exists for users to feel satisfaction, fulfillment, and gain powerful understanding of their habits and their place within the journey of life. Every visualization here must serve that reflective, exploratory purpose.

### Goals

1. Satellite View (quarter-level) introduces the Journey Balance Wheel
2. PERMA signal bars derived entirely from behavioral data
3. Topographic View (month-level) shows Milestone network with pace estimates
4. Zoom stack complete: Street → Trail → Topographic → Satellite
5. Journey hemisphere established as the exclusive home for data exploration and framework-driven insight

### Key Deliverables

**Journey Balance Wheel**
- Five-spoke radial SVG, one spoke per Journey
- Spoke length proportional to Step count for selected period
- Period selector: This Week / This Month / This Quarter
- Ghost outline of previous period for trend comparison
- Activity summary per Journey below wheel
- "Low activity" flag when Journey falls below 15% of total (text only: "Connections has been quieter this quarter.")

**PERMA Signal Bars**
- Five horizontal bars: Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment
- Signal strength derived entirely from behavioral data (no user input beyond logging Steps):
  - Positive Emotion → Step frequency + journey diversity indicating active life engagement
  - Engagement → consistency patterns, session clustering, deep Path investment
  - Relationships → proportion of Steps in Connections Journey
  - Meaning → proportion of Steps with a Path association
  - Accomplishment → completed Milestones + Step completion frequency
- Unified soft color for all bars (not five different colors)

**Topographic View (Month-Level)**
- Milestone cards: Journey color border, name, progress bar, recent contributing Steps, pace estimate
- Pace: simple extrapolation ("~2 weeks at current pace"), never deadline pressure language

### Technical Tasks

**New modules:**
- `src/wheel.js` — pure SVG wheel construction
- `src/perma.js` — `inferPermaSignals(steps)` returning 0–1 floats + renderer
- `src/satellite-view.js` — assembles wheel + PERMA + activity summary
- `src/topographic-view.js` — Milestone cards with progress and pace

**`src/main.js` changes:**
- Expand `currentView` to include `month` and `quarter`
- Wire period selector, four-level navigation

**CSS additions:**
- `.satellite-view`, `.topographic-view`
- `.balance-wheel`, `.journey-activity-summary`
- `.perma-bars`, `.perma-bar-row`, `.perma-bar__fill`
- `.milestone-card`, `.milestone-card__progress-bar`, `.milestone-card__pace`
- `.period-selector`
- `.view-nav` expanded to four items

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Balance Wheel renders correctly with 0–5 active Journeys (0 Steps = dot at center)
- [ ] Ghost outline is visually quiet — not a competing focal point
- [ ] PERMA bars derive entirely from behavioral data without any user input beyond logging Steps
- [ ] Topographic View shows milestones with at least one contributing step in last 90 days
- [ ] Pace estimate never uses deadline/failure/urgency language
- [ ] Full zoom stack navigates without data reload (load once, render per view)
- [ ] Satellite View feels like a quiet overview, not a dashboard of demands

### Data Visualization

Detailed data visualization specifications for the Journey hemisphere are to be defined. See `visualization-spec.md` for the existing visual language foundation. Visualization design will be informed by the Journey hemisphere's exclusive focus on data exploration, reflection, and framework-driven insight.

### Brand Guard

The PERMA bars are not a performance score. The Wheel is not a grading rubric. Both must be introduced with observational copy: "Here is how your energy has been distributed" — not "Here is how you're doing." No self-assessment prompts of any kind.

---

## Phase 4 — Ikigai, Polish, and PWA

*Add the deepest meaning layer, bring offline capability, and polish to release quality.*

### Goals

1. Ikigai Path alignment indicators per Path in Trail View
2. Offline-capable PWA (installable, offline Step creation queued)
3. Journey customization (rename, reorder, add custom, hide defaults)
4. Multi-user hardening and accessibility audit
5. All four zoom levels feel cohesive and polished

### Key Deliverables

**Ikigai Path Indicator**
- Per-Path indicator: four small circles (Love, Skill, Need, Paid)
- Filled = signal present; hollow = not yet present
- Love: inferred from frequency + consistency + voluntary return patterns
- Skill: inferred from Milestone completion rate + progression patterns
- Need: user-declared toggle on Path ("This benefits others")
- Paid: user-declared toggle on Path ("I earn from this")
- Optional one-sentence insight when genuinely meaningful (e.g., "Shows strong Love and developing Skill. Doesn't generate income — is that intentional?")
- No scoring. No comparison between Paths on Ikigai alignment.

**PWA / Offline**
- Service worker: cache app shell and static assets
- IndexedDB queue for offline Step creation, sync on reconnect
- `manifest.json` with "Today" name, icons, `standalone` display
- Offline indicator: "Working offline — steps will sync when you reconnect" (neutral, not error)

**Journey Customization**
- Settings screen: rename, reorder (up/down buttons), add custom Journey (constrained color palette)
- Hide a Journey (`is_hidden = true`) — Steps remain, Journey hidden from pickers
- Default Journeys cannot be deleted, only renamed or hidden

**Multi-User Hardening**
- Audit all RLS policies
- Verify `claim_anonymous_todos` handles Paths and step_paths
- Test second-user creation flow end to end

**Polish Pass**
- Copy audit against brand tone sliders (70/30 soft, 75/25 personal, 80/20 encouraging)
- Emotion-first checklist across all four views
- Micro-animation review: calm and continuous, not bouncy or celebratory
- Typography audit: Fraunces for headers/reflection, Source Sans 3 for body
- Accessibility: keyboard nav, focus management, ARIA live regions

### Technical Tasks

**New modules:**
- `src/ikigai.js` — `inferIkigaiSignals(path, steps)` + renderer
- `src/offline-queue.js` — IndexedDB wrapper + sync logic
- `src/settings.js` — Journey management UI

**Database Migration:**
```sql
-- Ikigai fields on paths
alter table public.paths
  add column benefits_others boolean not null default false,
  add column is_paid         boolean not null default false;

-- Journey customization
alter table public.journeys
  add column is_hidden boolean not null default false,
  add column color_key text;
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Ikigai indicators appear per Path only with 4+ weeks of data
- [ ] Love/Skill inferred from behavioral data; Need/Paid are factual user declarations
- [ ] App installs to home screen on iOS and Android, opens without browser chrome
- [ ] Offline Steps sync within 10 seconds of reconnection
- [ ] Second user gets own default Journeys, cannot see first user's data
- [ ] Custom Journey color appears correctly across all contexts (tile, header, wheel, trail)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all interactions
- [ ] Emotion-first checklist passes across all views

### Brand Guard

Ikigai indicators are informational, not prescriptive. A Path with only Love filled is a hobby, a joy — not a failure. Copy for incomplete alignment must be a genuine question ("Is that intentional?") not a suggestion ("Consider developing a skill here").

Offline state is a practical constraint, not a failure. "Working offline" — not "No connection — your data may be lost."

  ├─ requires Paths from Phase 2
  └─ requires behavioral data patterns from Phases 2+3
```

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Accessibility
- All interactive elements: `aria-label` or visible text
- Focus management: dropdowns move focus on open, return on close
- `aria-live="polite"` on step list and progress counter
- Color never sole information carrier — Journey slug text always accompanies color
- Touch targets: 44x44px minimum on mobile

### Performance
- Single-page, no routing library. View state is a JS variable.
- Load data once per session; update incrementally from user actions
- Add `created_at >= now() - interval '90 days'` filter as data grows
- SVG visualizations recomputed from in-memory state

### Data Strategy
- Load 90 days of Steps on auth, keep in module-level state
- Today: client-side filter from loaded data
- Trail View: last 8 weeks for sparklines
- Satellite View: 90 days or current quarter

### Testing Approach
- Manual QA per phase using emotion-first checklist from `brand-art-direction.md`
- Component isolation via existing `style-guide.html`
- Critical path smoke test before any merge: create Step, complete, delete, switch Journey, sign out, sign in — zero console errors

## Deferred Items

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Anonymous social comparison | Requires multiple active users; premature before validation |
| Reflection notes on Steps | Adds input weight; evaluate if behavioral inference proves insufficient for PERMA signals |
| Notification system | PWA notifications high friction on iOS; low priority |
| Calendar integration | Scope-expanding without clear demand |
| Data export/import | Useful but not core to the emotional experience |
| Dark mode | Warm neutral palette may suffice; evaluate after launch |
| Native iOS/Android | Out of scope per product brief |
| Historical data beyond 90 days | Pagination strategy needed when data volume is real |
| Team/collaborative journeys | Out of scope per product brief |
