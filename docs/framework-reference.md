## How Frameworks Operate in the Product

Frameworks are **not user-facing features**. Users input Steps. The system derives framework insights from behavioral data. Users never fill out PERMA questionnaires or Ikigai worksheets.

| Framework | Operates At | Question Answered | Input Source |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Wheel of Life | Journey level | "Is my life balanced?" | Step distribution + optional monthly satisfaction rating |
| PERMA | Step → Journey aggregation | "Am I flourishing?" | Quality tags, activity types, frequency, duration |
| Ikigai | Path level | "Where is authentic meaning?" | Frequency, quality tags, reflection notes, progression |

## Wheel of Life

### Origin
Created in the 1960s by Paul J. Meyer (Success Motivation® Institute). Roots in Tibetan Buddhist philosophy of balance-as-happiness. Now the most commonly used self-assessment instrument in coaching practice globally.

### The Model
A radial diagram where each spoke represents a life domain rated 1–10 for satisfaction. The resulting shape reveals imbalance through irregularity. A perfect circle = perfect balance (theoretical). An irregular shape = concentrated investment in some areas, neglect in others.

### Standard 8 Domains → Journey Tracker's 5 Journeys

| Standard Domain | Maps To | Journey |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| Health & Fitness | Physical well-being, exercise, sleep, nutrition | **Vitality** |
| Personal Growth, Fun & Recreation | Creative work, learning, skill-building, leisure | **Pursuits** |
| Career, Money & Finances | Professional work, business, financial management | **Prosperity** |
| Family & Friends, Romance | Relationships, community, social connection | **Connections** |
| Physical Environment | Home, chores, obligations, logistics | **Foundations** |

The consolidation from 8 to 5 domains reduces cognitive load while preserving the essential balance assessment.

### Application in Journey Tracker
- **Data source:** Count and distribution of Steps across the five Journeys over time
- **Visualization:** Five-spoke wheel showing relative investment per Journey
- **User input:** Optional monthly satisfaction rating (1–10) per Journey, triangulated against behavioral data
- **Insight type:** "You've invested heavily in Prosperity this month. Connections has declined 40% from last quarter."
- **Frequency:** Wheel shape updates continuously from Step data. Satisfaction prompt monthly.

### Key Design Principle
The wheel reveals *distribution*, not *deficiency*. An imbalanced wheel is diagnostic information, not a failure state. Language must be observational ("Connections is lower this quarter") never judgmental ("You're neglecting relationships").

## PERMA (Seligman's Well-Being Model)

### Origin
Developed by Martin Seligman in *Flourish* (2011), evolving from his earlier Authentic Happiness theory. PERMA defines five measurable pillars of well-being that together constitute "flourishing." Validated through the PERMA Profiler instrument (Butler & Kern, 2016).

### The Five Pillars

| Pillar | Definition | How It's Signaled in Steps |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **P** — Positive Emotion | Joy, gratitude, serenity, interest, hope, pride, amusement, inspiration, awe, love | Quality tags indicating positive felt experience (💪 🔥 ⚡) |
| **E** — Engagement | Flow states, deep absorption, challenge-skill balance (Csíkszentmihályi) | Complex/challenging Steps, duration signals, 🔥 flow tags |
| **R** — Relationships | Positive, meaningful connections with others | Steps involving other people, Connections Journey activity |
| **M** — Meaning | Serving something larger than self, values-aligned action | Service-oriented Steps, values-aligned Paths, reflection notes |
| **A** — Accomplishment | Achievement, competence, mastery, goal completion | Milestone progress, Step completion frequency, velocity trends |

### PERMA+ Extensions
Research has proposed additional dimensions: Physical Health (already captured by Vitality Journey), Mindfulness, Economic Security, Loneliness. These are captured implicitly through the Journey/Path structure rather than as separate PERMA dimensions.

### Application in Journey Tracker
- **Data source:** System-inferred from Step behavior, quality tags, and activity patterns
- **Visualization:** Five horizontal bars showing derived signal strength per PERMA dimension
- **User input:** None required. Quality tags (optional on Steps) feed the inference. Reflection notes (optional) refine Meaning signals.
- **Insight type:** "Strong Accomplishment signals this week. Engagement is lower — fewer complex or challenging Steps. Consider activities that stretch your skills."
- **Frequency:** Dashboard updated weekly. Trend comparison monthly.

### Key Design Principle
PERMA operates as a **derived output layer**, never an input form. The Opus research is explicit: "Instead of asking 'Rate your PERMA elements' (framework assessment burden), ask 'How did that feel?' (quality tags; behavioral input). System infers PERMA signals from accumulated quality tags."

### Signal Inference Logic

| PERMA Dimension | Inferred From |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Positive Emotion | Proportion of Steps with positive quality tags (💪 ⚡ 🎯) |
| Engagement | Steps with high duration, complexity indicators, or 🔥 flow tags |
| Relationships | Steps tagged to Connections Journey or involving other people |
| Meaning | Steps in service/values-aligned Paths, reflection notes mentioning purpose |
| Accomplishment | Milestone completion rate, Step completion frequency, velocity trends |

## Ikigai

### Origin
Japanese concept with dual interpretations relevant to Journey Tracker:

**Authentic Japanese (Kamiya, 1966; Hasegawa, 2001):** Ikigai means "that which makes life worth living" — small daily experiences that create a feeling of life being worthwhile. Not grand purpose, but present-moment engagement. Morning coffee, a satisfying run, quality time with family.

**Western Adaptation (Héctor García, 2016):** The four-circle Venn diagram — intersection of What You Love, What You're Good At, What the World Needs, What You Can Be Paid For. This version operates at the Path/career level, not the daily moment level.

### Dual Application in Journey Tracker

| Interpretation | Operates At | What It Reveals |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Authentic Japanese | Step level | Which daily actions carry genuine aliveness — the small joys that make waking up worthwhile |
| Western 4-Circle | Path level | Which Paths align love, skill, need, and compensation — purpose alignment of longer pursuits |

### The Four Circles (Western Model) Applied to Paths

| Circle | Signal Source | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| What You Love | Frequency + positive quality tags + reflection notes | "I write fiction 5x/week and tag it with 🔥 regularly" |
| What You're Good At | Progression difficulty, time investment, skill-development Steps | "My running pace has improved 15% over 3 months" |
| What the World Needs | Path category, service orientation, social impact indicators | "Teaching yoga benefits others' health" |
| What You Can Be Paid For | User-tagged economic value (explicit input if earning from activity) | "Freelance design generates income" |

### Named Deficiency States (Opus Research Finding)

When a Path has three of four circles but is missing one:

| Missing Circle | State | Example |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| Love | Comfortable but empty | "High-paying job you don't care about" |
| Skill | Excited but uncertain | "Passion project you haven't developed skills for" |
| Need | Satisfying but useless | "Hobby that serves no one but yourself" |
| Payment | Fulfilling but unsustainable | "Meaningful volunteer work that doesn't pay" |

These states are not judgments — they're awareness prompts. Many valuable Paths have only 1–2 circles filled, and that's appropriate.

### Application in Journey Tracker
- **Data source (daily ikigai):** Quality tags on Steps, frequency patterns, reflection notes
- **Data source (Path alignment):** Love/Skill/Need inferred from behavior; Paid is explicit user input
- **Visualization:** Per-Path alignment indicator showing which circles are filled
- **Insight type:** "Your Novel Writing path shows high Love and developing Skill. It doesn't pay yet — is that intentional, or something to explore?"
- **Frequency:** Ikigai signals update continuously. Path alignment review monthly.

### Key Design Principle
Ikigai analysis must never prescribe that all four circles need filling. Many of life's most meaningful activities (family time, exercise, volunteering) intentionally lack the "Paid" circle. The system observes alignment; the user decides what matters.

## Framework Interaction: Triangulation

The three frameworks analyzing the same behavioral data create a composite picture. When signals align, confidence is high. When they diverge, the system surfaces the tension as an insight.

### Alignment Example
User has high Vitality Steps + positive quality tags + improving Milestone pace.
- **Wheel:** Vitality domain is well-attended
- **PERMA:** Strong Positive Emotion and Accomplishment signals
- **Ikigai:** Fitness Path shows high Love and Skill
- **Insight:** "Your fitness practice is thriving across all dimensions."

### Divergence Example
User reports high Relationships satisfaction (Wheel: 8/10) but Connections Steps are declining.
- **Wheel:** Satisfaction reported high
- **PERMA:** Relationships signal weakening (fewer relational Steps)
- **Ikigai:** Not applicable at this level
- **Insight:** "You report strong relationship satisfaction, but connection time is trending down. Is quality compensating for quantity, or is satisfaction lagging behind behavioral change?"

### Data Flow Summary

```
User logs Step
  → Step has: activity, Journey tag, optional Path/Milestone, optional quality tag
    → Wheel: Step counted toward Journey domain balance
    → PERMA: Quality tags and activity type feed signal inference
    → Ikigai: Step frequency and tags contribute to Path alignment analysis
      → All three aggregate upward to produce composite life picture
```

## Implementation Priority

For the next build phase, framework implementation should follow this order:

1. **Wheel of Life (Journey balance)** — Simplest to implement. Requires only Step-count distribution across Journeys. No inference logic needed. Ship the five-spoke wheel visualization first.

2. **PERMA signals** — Requires quality tags on Steps (optional field) and inference logic mapping tags → dimensions. Can ship as a "Well-being snapshot" once quality tags exist in the data model.

3. **Ikigai alignment** — Most complex. Requires Path-level analysis against four circles, with Love and Skill inferred from behavior and Paid as explicit user input. Ship after Paths are fully implemented and used.
